**How the Flower Shop Online Store Works**  

At our flower shop‚Äôs online store, customers can browse and purchase beautifully arranged floral products with a seamless experience. Here‚Äôs how it works:  

### **1. Browsing Products**  
- Customers visit the website and explore different floral arrangements (e.g., bouquets, vases, gift sets) listed in the **`product`** table.  
- Each product displays its **base details** (name, description, price range, and product type).  

### **2. Selecting Variants (Size, Style, Customization)**  
- When a customer clicks on a product (e.g., "Rose Bouquet"), they see available **variants** from the **`product_variant`** table, such as:  
  - **Small (12 roses)** ‚Äì $29.99  
  - **Medium (24 roses)** ‚Äì $49.99  
  - **Large (36 roses + greenery)** ‚Äì $69.99  
- The system checks **real-time availability** by verifying inventory via **`product_composition`** (e.g., "Do we have enough roses for a Medium bouquet?").  

### **3. Adding to Cart & Checkout**  
- The customer selects their preferred **variant**, adjusts quantity, and adds it to their cart (stored in **`orderitem`**).  
- Optional **add-ons** (e.g., chocolates, greeting cards) from the **`addons`** table can be included (tracked in **`order_addon`**).  
- At checkout, the system:  
  - **Reserves inventory** (deducts stock temporarily via **`inventory_transaction`**).  
  - Records the **order details** (customer info, delivery address, payment status).  

### **4. Order Fulfillment**  
- Staff receive the order and prepare it based on the **`product_composition`** breakdown (e.g., "Medium Rose Bouquet = 24 roses + 5 greenery stems").  
- Once assembled, the order status updates to **"Ready for Delivery"**, and inventory is permanently adjusted.  

### **5. Delivery & Customer Satisfaction**  
- The bouquet is delivered on the scheduled date.  
- The customer earns **loyalty points** (tracked in **`customer`**) for future discounts.
