I understand you need a database design for a laundry shop business that supports both a website and walk-in customers. The business offers three main services: wash, dry, and iron, with different pricing tiers. They also sell soap products separately. The website requires user registration and different user roles: admin, customer, and staff. The system should support service picking and ordering for both online and walk-in customers.

I will design a relational database schema that covers the following entities and relationships:

- Users: with roles (admin, customer, staff)
- Services: wash, dry, iron with different tiers and prices
- Soap products: separate product offerings sold as add-ons or standalone
- Orders: capturing customer orders, with details of chosen services and products
- Order items: details on individual services or products in an order
- Possibly track staff assignments for orders (e.g., who processed which order)
- Service tiers/pricing linked with each service
- User registration data (profile, login info)
- Support for walk-in (offline) orders as well as online orders

Plan:
- Table: Users (id, name, email, password_hash, role, contact info, etc.)
- Table: Services (id, name [wash, dry, iron], description)
- Table: ServiceTiers (id, service_id, tier_name, price)
- Table: Products (id, name, description, price, stock_qty) - for soaps
- Table: Orders (id, user_id, order_date, status, total_price, type [walk-in/online])
- Table: OrderItems (id, order_id, item_type [service/product], item_id, quantity, unit_price, total_price)
- Table: StaffAssignments (id, order_id, staff_user_id, assigned_date, status)

Dependent files to be edited:
- N/A (design only)

Followup steps:
- Confirm requirements and any additional data needed
- Create an ER diagram if necessary
- Implement the database schema in SQL or preferred DBMS
- Develop backend logic for user roles and ordering workflows


Here is the proposed database structure for the laundry shop management system supporting website and walk-in customers:

Users
- user_id (PK)
- name
- email (unique)
- password_hash
- role (enum: 'admin', 'customer', 'staff')
- phone
- address
- created_at
- updated_at

Services
- service_id (PK)
- name (e.g. 'wash', 'dry', 'iron')
- description

ServiceTiers
- tier_id (PK)
- service_id (FK to Services)
- tier_name (e.g. 'basic', 'premium')
- price

Products
- product_id (PK)
- name (e.g. 'soap type A')
- description
- price
- stock_quantity
- created_at
- updated_at

Orders
- order_id (PK)
- user_id (FK to Users) (nullable for walk-in if anonymous)
- order_date
- status (e.g. 'pending', 'in_progress', 'completed', 'cancelled')
- total_amount
- order_type (enum: 'online', 'walk_in')
- assigned_staff_id (FK to Users for staff processing order, nullable)
- created_at
- updated_at

OrderItems
- order_item_id (PK)
- order_id (FK to Orders)
- item_type (enum: 'service', 'product')
- item_id (FK to Services or Products depending on item_type)
- tier_id (FK to ServiceTiers, nullable if item_type is product)
- quantity
- unit_price
- total_price

This structure supports:
- Different pricing tiers per service
- Selling different soap products
- Orders containing multiple services and/or products
- User roles for admin, customer, staff
- Tracking which staff handled each order
- Both online and walk-in orders (anonymous or with user record)

Please confirm if you'd like me to create SQL DDL scripts for this design or if you want me to adjust or add additional features.
